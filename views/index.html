        <h3>My Educational Life</h3>
        <p class="act-paragraph">
          My education life was unusual. After studying the 1st grade in Turkey,
          the 2nd and 3rd grades in Belgium, and the 2 semesters of the 4th grade
          in 2 different schools in Turkey, I continue my secondary school education
          in Muğla Datça, where I am currently studying.

        <h3>My Programming Life</h3>
        <p class="act-paragraph">
          I have been studying at a programming course called
          <a href="https://bilisimschool.com" target="_blank">Bilişim School</a>
          since June 2021. I have knowledge in Python, Html, Css, Javascript,
          Mongo.db, Node.js and I have done various projects.

        <h3>Courses I Studied</h3>
        <p class="act-paragraph">
          I took many courses both abroad and in Turkey. I took a chess course
          abroad and came second in the Flemish region there. In Turkey, apart
          from the school's Support and Training Courses, I became interested in
          programming. In line with my curiosity, I started looking for software courses.
          It was during this time that I met
          <a href="https://bilisimschool.com" target="_blank">Bilişim School</a>.
          I owe my ability to write this portfolio right now to the sincere process
          that followed this acquaintance. The process started with scratch, then
          continued with Python, and then I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js,
          Express and React.

        <h3>My Game Developnet Life</h3>
        <p class="act-paragraph">
          In 2023, I was asked to do a simple project for the school, so I gathered a
          team of 4 people and got to work. It was the first quality game I made called
          SpaceMath, the game was simply a math game for primary and secondary school
          children. Before I started making this game, I didn't know Unreal Engine,
          so I made it via Scratch, but I didn't expect the game to go this far.
          The game was first exhibited at the 4006 Tübitak Science Fair and then went
          to places such as Teknofest. When I realized that the game had grown so much,
          I decided to learn Unreal Engine 5 in the summer of 2024 and do the project there.
          This was the first game I made in Unreal Engine.
